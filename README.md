IA2013-USP
==========

Repository for control of the IA study group activities.


Goals:
  - Study and approve IA (USP 2013) of corse
  - Write all code in english (varg: i think that it will be cool :) )
  - Do exercises early for the test
  - Generate some of pression about the course ;)

Ideas
  - Do exercises and solve questions in agreement with the class
  - Make a easy programming exercise, implementing all the search algorithms (it's still an idea)

Restrictions
  - Because it's likely that this code will be used to the Eps, will be write in C++
  - If for didactic propouse is necesary the use of graphics interfaces, will use QT, leave it very 
    modular (case we will can not use QT in the EPs)
  - Neither is pressent homework to somebody, its only refer material. If somebody doesn't have time,
    or somthing, it's ok

Enjoy!
